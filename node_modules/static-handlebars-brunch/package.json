  "readme": "# static-handlebars-brunch\n\nstatic-handlebars-brunch is a Brunch plugin that facilitates the use of\nHandlebars as a build-time templating engine. This is useful if you have many\n\"static\" pages that need the ability to include partials or other dynamic\ncontent at build time.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd `static-handlebars-brunch` to your `package.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"static-handlebars-brunch\": \"~ 0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd install dependecies.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nAny `.hbs` file found in `app/templates` will be compiled to `.html` and copied\ninto `app/assets`. Brunch will then copy `app/assets` to `public`.\n\n## Partials\n\nA partial is any `.hbs` file in `app/templates` that begins with an underscore,\nfor example: `app/templates/_header.hbs`.\n\nYou can use the standard Handlebars partial helper to include partials in a\ntemplate:\n\n```hbs\n{{> header}}\n\n<p>This is a page!</p>\n\n{{> footer}}\n```\n\nA custom partial helper is available which allows you to pass variables to your\npartials.\n\n```hbs\n{{partial \"header\" title=\"My great page\"}}\n\n<p>This is a page!</p>\n\n{{> \"footer\"}}\n```\n\n## TODO\n\nThis library has a long way to go in terms of configurability and compatability\nwith other workflows. The following are known features which we would like to\nsupport. Feel free to send a pull request if you end up implementing any.\n\n* Support a custom source path (ie. `app/templates`).\n* Support a custom compilation path (ie. `app/assets`).\n* Play nicely with `handlebars-brunch` (ie. figure out how to support both\n  plugins in one app).\n* Support custom extensions (only `.hbs` is supported now).\n* Cache partials (right now partials are recompiled up every time a file is\n  changed).\n* Write tests\n\n## License\n\nstatic-handlebars-brunch is an open source project released under the MIT\nLicense. See `MIT-LICENSE` in the project root for more details.\n",
